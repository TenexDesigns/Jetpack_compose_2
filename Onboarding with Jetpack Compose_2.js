To implement onboarding screens and a splash screen using Jetpack Compose, you can take advantage of the Compose navigation component and the new Splash API introduced in Android 12. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Set up dependencies: Ensure you have the necessary dependencies in your project. Include the following in your app-level build.gradle file:
groovy
Copy code
dependencies {
    // ... other dependencies

    def compose_version = "1.0.0"
    implementation "androidx.activity:activity-compose:1.4.0-alpha03"
    implementation "androidx.navigation:navigation-compose:2.4.0-alpha08"
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui:$compose_version"
    implementation "androidx.compose.material:material:$compose_version"
}
Make sure to use the latest versions of the dependencies.

Create your onboarding screens: Design your onboarding screens using Jetpack Compose, typically in separate composable functions. Each screen can be a separate composable function, and you can navigate between them using the Compose navigation component.
kotlin
Copy code
@Composable
fun OnboardingScreen1() {
    // Content for the first onboarding screen
}

@Composable
fun OnboardingScreen2() {
    // Content for the second onboarding screen
}

@Composable
fun OnboardingScreen3() {
    // Content for the third onboarding screen
}
Set up navigation: Define your navigation graph using the Compose navigation component. Create a NavHost composable that contains the onboarding screens as destinations.
kotlin
Copy code
@Composable
fun OnboardingNavigation() {
    val navController = rememberNavController()

    NavHost(navController, startDestination = "onboardingScreen1") {
        composable("onboardingScreen1") {
            OnboardingScreen1()
        }
        composable("onboardingScreen2") {
            OnboardingScreen2()
        }
        composable("onboardingScreen3") {
            OnboardingScreen3()
        }
    }
}
Set up the Splash screen: Android 12 introduced a new Splash API that allows you to define a splash screen using Compose. To set up the splash screen, create a new activity that extends androidx.activity.ComponentActivity and override the onCreate() method.
kotlin
Copy code
class SplashActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        setContent {
            Surface(color = Color.White) {
                // Your splash screen content here
            }
        }

        // Set a delay to transition to the onboarding screen
        Handler(Looper.getMainLooper()).postDelayed({
            startActivity(Intent(this@SplashActivity, MainActivity::class.java))
            finish()
        }, 2000)
    }
}
In the onCreate() method, set the content view with the Compose content for the splash screen. You can design the splash screen using Compose composable functions. In this example, a delay of 2000 milliseconds is added before transitioning to the MainActivity. Adjust the delay as needed.

Update the manifest: Update your app's manifest file to set the SplashActivity as the launcher activity.
xml
Copy code
<activity
    android:name=".SplashActivity"
    android:theme="@style/Theme.YourApp.Splash"
    android:screenOrientation="portrait">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
    </intent-filter>
</activity>
Make sure to define a custom theme for the splash screen (@style/Theme.YourApp.Splash in the example above).

Update the MainActivity: In your MainActivity, set the OnboardingNavigation composable as the content view.
kotlin
Copy code
class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContent {
            OnboardingNavigation()
        }
    }
}
With these steps, you have implemented the onboarding screens using Jetpack Compose and a splash screen using the new Splash API. The splash screen will be displayed when the app launches, and after a certain delay, it will transition to the main activity, which contains the onboarding screens.

Remember to customize the onboarding screens and splash screen content based on your app's requirements.
