In Material 3, the Card composable function has similar parameters as in Material 2, but with a few changes. Here's an example using Material 3:

import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.padding
import androidx.compose.material3.Card
import androidx.compose.material3.Surface
import androidx.compose.material3.Text
import androidx.compose.runtime.Composable
import androidx.compose.ui.Modifier
import androidx.compose.ui.graphics.Color
import androidx.compose.ui.unit.dp

@Composable
fun MyCard() {
    Surface {
        Card(
            modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp),
            border = BorderStroke(width = 2.dp, color = Color.Green),
            elevation = CardDefaults.cardElevation(defaultElevation = 4.dp)
        ) {
            Text(
                text = "This is a card with border and elevation in Jetpack Compose Material 3",
                modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp)
            )
        }
    }
}
The Card composable function in Material 3 has the following parameters:

modifier: A Modifier that can be used to apply additional styling or layout behavior to the card, such as padding, sizing, or positioning semicolonspace.com.
shape: The shape of the card's outline, typically a rounded rectangle semicolonspace.com.
color: The background color of the card developer.android.com.
contentColor: The preferred color of the card's content (children) semicolonspace.com.
border: An optional border that can be drawn around the card semicolonspace.com.
elevation: The elevation of the card, which affects the shadow it casts. In Material 3, it requires a CardElevation object. You can use the CardDefaults.cardElevation function to create a CardElevation object with the desired elevation developer.android.com.
content: A composable lambda that defines the content (children) of the card semicolonspace.com.
Note that the Card composable is now within a Surface composable, which is a common pattern in Material 3 to provide a background and elevation for the content developer.android.com.
