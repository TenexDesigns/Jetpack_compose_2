Nested navigation in Jetpack Compose allows you to create hierarchies of screens or destinations within your app. It provides a way to navigate between multiple levels of screens while maintaining separate navigation stacks for each level. Here's how you can implement nested navigation:

Create a nested navigation graph:
First, create a nested navigation graph using the navigation composable function within your main navigation graph. This will define the nested navigation hierarchy. For example:

kotlin
Copy code
composable("home") {
    val nestedNavHostController = rememberNavController()
    NavHost(
        navController = nestedNavHostController,
        startDestination = "nested_screen1"
    ) {
        composable("nested_screen1") { NestedScreen1() }
        composable("nested_screen2") { NestedScreen2() }
    }
}
In this example, the "home" destination has its own nested navigation graph with "nested_screen1" and "nested_screen2" as its destinations.

Navigate within the nested graph:
To navigate within the nested graph, you need to obtain the NavController instance for the nested graph. You can achieve this by using the rememberNavController function within the composable function where the nested graph is defined, as shown in the previous example. Then, you can use this NavController to navigate within the nested graph. For example:

kotlin
Copy code
navController.navigate("home/nested_screen1")
This code snippet navigates to the "nested_screen1" destination within the nested graph.

Handle back navigation within the nested graph:
When handling back navigation within the nested graph, you need to ensure that you are navigating within the correct NavController instance. You can achieve this by passing the nested NavController to the NavHost composable and using it as the navController parameter. For example:

kotlin
Copy code
composable("home") {
    val nestedNavHostController = rememberNavController()
    NavHost(
        navController = nestedNavHostController,
        startDestination = "nested_screen1"
    ) {
        // Destinations within the nested graph
    }
}
By doing this, back navigation will be handled within the nested graph using the appropriate NavController instance.

Nested navigation allows you to create complex navigation flows with multiple levels of screens or destinations in Jetpack Compose. By defining nested navigation graphs and using the corresponding NavController instances, you can navigate within and handle back navigation for each level of the hierarchy.

Nested navigation in Jetpack Compose allows you to create a hierarchical structure for your navigation, making it easier to manage and maintain. It helps you group related composables into separate navigation graphs and navigate between them. Here's how you can implement nested navigation in Jetpack Compose:

Create a nested NavHost: In your main NavHost, create a nested NavHost for the group of composables you want to nest. Define a route for the nested NavHost and set its startDestination:
NavHost(navController, startDestination = "main") {
    composable("main") { MainScreen(navController) }
    navigation(startDestination = "sub1", route = "subgraph") {
        composable("sub1") { SubScreen1(navController) }
        composable("sub2") { SubScreen2(navController) }
    }
}
In this example, SubScreen1 and SubScreen2 are nested inside a subgraph route.

Navigate to the nested NavHost: When navigating to the nested NavHost, use the navigate() method to navigate to the route of the nested NavHost:
@Composable
fun MainScreen(navController: NavController) {
    Button(onClick = { navController.navigate("subgraph") }) {
        Text(text = "Navigate to Sub Screen 1")
    }
}
Navigate between nested composables: Inside the nested NavHost, you can navigate between the nested composables using the NavController:
@Composable
fun SubScreen1(navController: NavController) {
    Button(onClick = { navController.navigate("sub2") }) {
        Text(text = "Navigate to Sub Screen 2")
    }
}
By following these steps, you can implement nested navigation in Jetpack Compose, making it easier to manage and maintain the navigation structure of your app.
