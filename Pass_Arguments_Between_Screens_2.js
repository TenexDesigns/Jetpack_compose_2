In Jetpack Compose, you can send arguments between screens or destinations during navigation. There are different ways to pass arguments depending on your requirements, such as required arguments, optional arguments, single arguments, and multiple arguments. Here's how you can achieve that:

Required Arguments:
To pass required arguments, you can include them directly in the destination route when defining the composable function. Here's an example:

kotlin
Copy code
composable("details/{itemId}") { backStackEntry ->
    val itemId = backStackEntry.arguments?.getString("itemId")
    // Use the itemId in the destination composable
}
In this example, the "details" destination expects a required "itemId" argument. You can retrieve the argument using the arguments property of BackStackEntry inside the composable.

Optional Arguments:
If you have optional arguments, you can include them in the route with a default value and make them nullable. Here's an example:

kotlin
Copy code
composable("details/{itemId}/{optionalArg?}") { backStackEntry ->
    val itemId = backStackEntry.arguments?.getString("itemId")
    val optionalArg = backStackEntry.arguments?.getString("optionalArg")
    // Use the itemId and optionalArg in the destination composable
}
In this case, the "optionalArg" is specified with a "?" at the end, indicating it is an optional argument. You can check if the optional argument is present and use it accordingly.

Single Argument:
If you want to pass a single argument, you can use the navigate function of the NavController to pass the argument along with the destination route. Here's an example:

kotlin
Copy code
navController.navigate("details/$itemId")
In this example, $itemId is the value of the argument that will be passed to the "details" destination.

Multiple Arguments:
When passing multiple arguments, you can include them in the destination route separated by slashes and retrieve them individually in the destination composable. Here's an example:

kotlin
Copy code
navController.navigate("details/$itemId/$itemName")
In this example, $itemId and $itemName are separate arguments passed to the "details" destination. You can retrieve them using the arguments property in the destination composable.

Remember to define the corresponding arguments in the navigation graph and access them using the same keys in the destination composable.

By using these techniques, you can pass arguments between screens or destinations during navigation in Jetpack Compose. Whether you have required or optional arguments, single or multiple arguments, you can customize the navigation based on your specific requirements.

To send arguments between screens in Jetpack Compose, you can use the NavController and NavHost components to define routes with placeholders for your arguments. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

Define the route with placeholders: In your NavHost, define the route for the destination composable with a placeholder for the argument you want to pass.
NavHost(navController, startDestination = "home") {
    composable("home") { HomeScreen(navController) }
    composable("details/{noteId}") { backStackEntry ->
        val noteId = backStackEntry.arguments?.getString("noteId")
        DetailsScreen(noteId = noteId, navController = navController)
    }
}
In this example, the details route has a placeholder {noteId} for the note ID argument.

Navigate with arguments: When navigating to the destination composable, pass the argument by substituting the placeholder in the route with the actual value.
@Composable
fun HomeScreen(navController: NavController) {
    val noteId = "123"
    Button(onClick = { navController.navigate("details/$noteId") }) {
        Text(text = "View Details")
    }
}
Retrieve the argument in the destination composable: In the destination composable, you can access the argument by extracting it from the backStackEntry of the NavHost.
@Composable
fun DetailsScreen(noteId: String?, navController: NavController) {
    Text(text = "Note ID: $noteId")
}
By following these steps, you can pass arguments between screens in Jetpack Compose and use them to display relevant information or perform actions in the destination composable.
