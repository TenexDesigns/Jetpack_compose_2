To handle TextField focus and switching between TextFields with IME actions, you can use the LocalFocusManager and LocalSoftwareKeyboardController to control the focus and keyboard visibility medium.com. For example, you can request focus on the next TextField when the "Next" button is pressed on the soft keyboard, or clear focus and hide the keyboard when the "Done" button is pressed.
