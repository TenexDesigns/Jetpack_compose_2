Room Database is a part of Android Jetpacks Architecture Components and is highly recommended for local storage in Android development. 
It is an abstraction layer over SQLite and provides a more robust way to access databases while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
Room reduces boilerplate code by automatically mapping database objects to Java or Kotlin objects and works with observable frameworks like RxJava and LiveData medium.com.

The main components of Room Database are:

Database - An abstract class or Singleton
Entity (table) - A data class
DAO (Database Access Object) - An interface class, which makes queries on the Entity using API medium.com.
Room vs SQLite

Room is an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) library that maps database objects to Java or Kotlin objects, providing an abstraction layer over SQLite. Some advantages of Room over SQLite are:

Compile-time validation of raw SQLite queries
Automatic mapping between SQL queries and Java or Kotlin data objects, reducing boilerplate code
Easier schema updates
Built-in support for LiveData and RxJava for data observation
SQLite, on the other hand, does not provide these features and requires more manual work to achieve similar functionality medium.com.

To work with Room Database in Jetpack Compose, you would follow the same steps as you would in a traditional Android project,
  using ViewModel, Repository pattern, and Room components. The main difference is that you'll observe the data changes in your composables, and update the UI accordingly.

Heres a high-level overview of the steps to integrate Room Database with Jetpack Compose:

Create a Room Entity for your data model.
Define a DAO interface with query methods.
Create a Room Database Singleton to access the DAO.
Implement a Repository to interact with the DAO.
Create a ViewModel that uses the Repository to load and manage the data.
In your composable functions, use the ViewModel to observe data changes and update the UI.

  To integrate Room Database with Jetpack Compose, you can follow this tutorial from answertopia.com. The tutorial demonstrates how to implement SQLite-based database storage using the Room persistence library, ViewModel, and Repository pattern in a Jetpack Compose project. Here is an outline of the steps you'll need to follow:

Add the required dependencies: Include the necessary Room and Coroutine dependencies to your build.gradle file.
Create the Room Entity: Define a data class that represents your table and annotate it with @Entity.
Define the DAO: Create an interface that represents your Data Access Object (DAO) and annotate it with @Dao. Define the methods for querying the database in this interface.
Create the Room Database: Define an abstract class that extends RoomDatabase, annotate it with @Database, and declare an abstract function to get the DAO.
Implement the Repository: Create a Repository class that uses the DAO to interact with the database.
Create the ViewModel: Implement a ViewModel that uses the Repository to load and manage the data.
Use the ViewModel in Composables: In your composable functions, use the ViewModel to observe data changes and update the UI accordingly.
This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide, along with code samples, to help you understand and integrate Room Database with Jetpack Compose. By following the tutorial, you can create an efficient, reactive, and well-structured data layer for your Jetpack Compose project.

To provide code samples for integrating Room Database with Jetpack Compose, let's use a simple example of a note-taking app. We'll create a list of notes and display them using Jetpack Compose.

Add the required dependencies: Include the necessary Room and Coroutine dependencies in your build.gradle file.
implementation 'androidx.room:room-runtime:2.4.2'
kapt 'androidx.room:room-compiler:2.4.2'
implementation 'androidx.room:room-ktx:2.4.2'
Create the Room Entity: Define a data class that represents your table and annotate it with @Entity.
@Entity
data class Note(
    @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true) val id: Int = 0,
    val title: String,
    val content: String
)
Define the DAO: Create an interface that represents your Data Access Object (DAO) and annotate it with @Dao. Define the methods for querying the database in this interface.
@Dao
interface NoteDao {
    @Query("SELECT * FROM Note")
    fun getAllNotes(): Flow<List<Note>>

    @Insert
    suspend fun insert(note: Note)

    @Delete
    suspend fun delete(note: Note)
}
Create the Room Database: Define an abstract class that extends RoomDatabase, annotate it with @Database, and declare an abstract function to get the DAO.
@Database(entities = [Note::class], version = 1)
abstract class AppDatabase : RoomDatabase() {
    abstract fun noteDao(): NoteDao
}
Implement the Repository: Create a Repository class that uses the DAO to interact with the database.
class NoteRepository(private val noteDao: NoteDao) {
    val allNotes: Flow<List<Note>> = noteDao.getAllNotes()

    suspend fun insert(note: Note) {
        noteDao.insert(note)
    }

    suspend fun delete(note: Note) {
        noteDao.delete(note)
    }
}
Create the ViewModel: Implement a ViewModel that uses the Repository to load and manage the data.
class NoteViewModel(private val repository: NoteRepository) : ViewModel() {
    val allNotes = repository.allNotes.asLiveData()

    fun insert(note: Note) = viewModelScope.launch {
        repository.insert(note)
    }

    fun delete(note: Note) = viewModelScope.launch {
        repository.delete(note)
    }
}
Use the ViewModel in Composables: In your composable functions, use the ViewModel to observe data changes and update the UI accordingly.
@Composable
fun NoteList(viewModel: NoteViewModel) {
    val notes by viewModel.allNotes.collectAsState(initial = emptyList())

    LazyColumn {
        items(notes) { note ->
            Text(text = note.title)
            Text(text = note.content)
        }
    }
}
This is a simplified example that demonstrates how to integrate Room Database with Jetpack Compose. You can further customize the UI and add functionality as needed.
