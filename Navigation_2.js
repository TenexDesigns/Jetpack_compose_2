Navigation in Jetpack Compose can be achieved using the navigation-compose library, which provides a way to navigate between different composables with navigation components features. Here's an overview of the main concepts:

NavController: A NavController is an object that manages app navigation within a NavHost. You can create a NavController using the rememberNavController() method in your composable:
val navController = rememberNavController()
NavHost: A NavHost is a container for navigation destinations. It requires the NavController created with rememberNavController() and the route of the starting destination of your graph:
NavHost(navController, startDestination = "profile") {
    composable("profile") { ProfileScreen(navController) }
    composable("friendslist") { FriendsListScreen(navController) }
}
Navigate between Composables: To navigate to a composable, use the navigate() method:
fun ProfileScreen(navController: NavController) {
    Button(onClick = { navController.navigate("friendslist") }) {
        Text(text = "Navigate to Friends List")
    }
}
Passing Arguments: You can pass arguments between destinations using the navController.navigate() method and a route with placeholders:
// In the NavHost
composable("details/{noteId}") { backStackEntry ->
    val noteId = backStackEntry.arguments?.getString("noteId")
    DetailsScreen(noteId = noteId, navController = navController)
}

// Navigating with an argument
Button(onClick = { navController.navigate("details/${note.id}") }) {
    Text(text = "View Details")
}
Navigate Back: To navigate back by "popping" the current screen and going back to the previous one, use the popBackStack() method:
@Composable
fun DetailsScreen(noteId: String?, navController: NavHostController) {
    Button(onClick = { navController.popBackStack() }) {
        Text(text = "Back")
    }
}
By following these concepts, you can implement navigation in your Jetpack Compose app, efficiently managing navigation between different composables and handling arguments passed between destinations.

In Jetpack Compose, navigation is handled by the Navigation component, which provides a declarative way to navigate between different screens or destinations in your app. It consists of several key components: NavController, NavHost, and NavigationGraph.

NavController:
The NavController is responsible for managing navigation within your app. It keeps track of the current destination and allows you to navigate between destinations. It provides functions like navigate, popBackStack, and navigateUp to handle navigation actions. To use NavController, you need to create an instance of it in your activity or composable and associate it with a NavHost:

kotlin
Copy code
val navController = rememberNavController()
NavHost:
The NavHost is a composable that acts as a container for displaying the current destination. It is where your screens or composables will be displayed based on the current navigation state. You can use the NavHost composable in your activity or within other composables:

kotlin
Copy code
NavHost(navController, startDestination = "home") {
    composable("home") { HomeScreen() }
    composable("profile") { ProfileScreen() }
    // ...
}
NavigationGraph:
The NavigationGraph defines the structure and connections between destinations in your app. It is a collection of destinations that can be navigated to. You can define the graph using the navGraph DSL or XML-based navigation graph. Each destination is represented by a composable or screen and can be connected using actions:

kotlin
Copy code
navGraph(startDestination = "home") {
    composable("home") { HomeScreen() }
    composable("profile") { ProfileScreen() }
    // ...
}
Navigation Actions:
Navigation actions define the flow and transitions between destinations. You can define actions in your navigation graph to navigate from one destination to another. For example:

kotlin
Copy code
navGraph(startDestination = "home") {
    composable("home") {
        HomeScreen(onProfileClicked = { navController.navigate("profile") })
    }
    composable("profile") { ProfileScreen() }
}
In the above example, the HomeScreen composable has a button that triggers the navigation to the "profile" destination when clicked.

Navigation Parameters:
You can pass parameters or arguments between destinations during navigation. This can be achieved by specifying arguments in the destination composable and passing them when navigating. For example:

kotlin
Copy code
composable(
    "profile/{userId}",
    arguments = listOf(navArgument("userId") { type = NavType.IntType })
) { backStackEntry ->
    val userId = backStackEntry.arguments?.getInt("userId")
    ProfileScreen(userId)
}
In this case, the "profile" destination expects a "userId" parameter, which can be accessed in the ProfileScreen composable.

Navigation Events and Observers:
You can listen for navigation events or observe the navigation state using DisposableEffect or LaunchedEffect to perform side effects or update UI accordingly. For example:

kotlin
Copy code
LaunchedEffect(navController) {
    val navBackStackEntry by navController.currentBackStackEntryAsState()
    val currentDestination = navBackStackEntry?.destination?.route
    // Update UI or perform side effects based on current destination
}
These are the basic concepts of navigation in Jetpack Compose. By utilizing NavController, NavHost, and NavigationGraph, you can create a navigation flow and handle navigation actions between different destinations or screens in your app.
