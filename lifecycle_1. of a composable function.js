In Jetpack Compose, the lifecycle of a composable function is simplified compared to the traditional Android view lifecycle. Composable lifecycle can be divided into three main phases:

Composition
Recomposition (when needed)
Disposal
In Jetpack Compose, UI components are reactive, which means that when the data changes, the UI is automatically updated due to recomposition. Compose uses a technique called "smart recomposition" which only updates the affected parts of the UI, instead of the entire UI tree kodeco.com.

To bridge between the composable lifecycle and the traditional Android view lifecycle, you can use LifecycleOwner and DisposableEffect to make composable functions aware of the views lifecycle betterprogramming.pub. Here's an example of how to create a lifecycle-aware composable:

import androidx.compose.runtime.Composable
import androidx.compose.runtime.DisposableEffect
import androidx.compose.runtime.LaunchedEffect
import androidx.lifecycle.Lifecycle
import androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleOwner
import androidx.lifecycle.LifecycleRegistry

@Composable
fun LifecycleAwareComposable(lifecycleOwner: LifecycleOwner, content: @Composable () -> Unit) {
    val lifecycle = rememberUpdatedState(lifecycleOwner.lifecycle)

    DisposableEffect(lifecycle.value) {
        val observer = object : DefaultLifecycleObserver {
            override fun onStart(owner: LifecycleOwner) {
                // Handle lifecycle event here
            }
        }
        lifecycle.value.addObserver(observer)
        onDispose {
            lifecycle.value.removeObserver(observer)
        }
    }

    content()
}
In this example, we create a LifecycleAwareComposable that accepts a LifecycleOwner as a parameter. 
We use DisposableEffect to observe the views lifecycle and handle the lifecycle events accordingly.
When the composable is disposed, the observer is automatically removed.
This way, you can create composable functions that are aware of the view lifecycle and react to it accordingly.
